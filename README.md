### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**dinakazakevich/dinakazakevich** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Dina â€” a multidisciplinary QA Engineer, with over 5 years of experience in software testing. Passionate about quality engineering, automation, and the shift-left approach. Iâ€™m also a content creator with a total of 33K subscribers across all platforms. 

I build and maintain full-cycle testing and automation frameworks in companies without existing infrastructure or processes. I've worked with companies like Adalo, TestLauncher, Evolve IP, and Invoice Simple. 

I work best in teams that value collaboration, autonomy, and a quality-first mindset, keeping things efficient, flexible, and fun to build together. My values include: 

- **Cross-functional communication**. As a QA Engineer, I thrive in environments where people communicate across functions. Being able to receive and provide feedback at all stages of product development. 

- **Autonomy**. By autonomy, I mean being able to debug code, to set up and maintain CI/CD workflows, or to deploy changes to test environments without distracting engineers from their work. 

- **Shift-left approach**. I foster a culture of quality, collaborating with engineering, product, and design teams to embed quality at every stage of development, rather than treating it as a last-minute task.

- **Iterations and frequent feedback**. I embrace iterative culture in my work. Before picking an approach or a tool, I build out a proof of concept version to test it in real-life conditions and gather team feedback. 

- **Balance**. I balance pragmatism with efficiency to keep things moving forward by combining context-driven and holistic testing approaches with modern tools and automation. 

- **Asynchronous collaboration**. Asynchronous collaboration helps teams minimize face-to-face call times while also maximizing focused work time and  preventing knowledge silos. 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking to join new projects that include JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Cypress, Playwright, Puppeteer, GitHub CI/CD, Postman API-automation
